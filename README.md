-A MapReduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel    manner. 
-The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks.
-Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system. 
-The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.
